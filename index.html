            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
              language. It is a small and lightweight language.
              Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
               JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
                programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects,
               such as Array, Data and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
             operators, control structures, and statements.
             Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
             supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
